Risk Assessment and Mitigation
==============================
Introduction
------------
Risk management is an important part of any project, we must prepare for
what could happen during the course of the project in order to be able
to quickly recover and stay on track. The risks which are shown below
are relevant to the particular SEPR context and take into account the
scale of the project and aim to cover only risks which are realistic
within this context.  The risks are here presented in a tabular format.
This table is split into 6 columns, the first column gives the risk an
ID number for easy reference if a risk does happen and we need to
resolve it. The second column describes the risk itself. The third
column gives an estimated likelihood of the risk occurring, this is done
using the following :

High :=High likelihood, there is a good chance that
this risk will    occur . Roughly a 75% chance.

Medium :=Medium likelihood, there is an equal chance of the
risk occurring or not occurring. Roughly a 50% chance.

Low :=Low likelihood, this risk is not likely to
occur. Roughly a 25% chance although some extreme risks could be a lot
lower.


The fourth column describes the impact the risk would have on progress in the
project. The fifth column shows the severity of the impact using this:

Low :=Low severity, may mean a few hours extra work
but nothing major.

Medium :=Medium severity, could add up to a week of
extra work and may threaten a deadline.

High :=High severity , a major set back which could
affect the whole project.

The sixth and final column details how we will aim
to avoid such a risk and deal with it. The overall table is split into
sections which group together similar risk such as software risks . Each
section is then ordered by severity, highest first. Equal severity is
ordered by likelihood. This table will be regularly consulted in an
attempt to monitor the risks and try to ensure they do not occur and
catch them early if they are occurring.
